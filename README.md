# Data-Base-2023-2024
Here is all the information about my database, which has been developed since 2023 on the basis of SQL.
# About my Data Base
The presented database was developed during the third year of study.
The development was carried out using Postgresql and in my opinion was successful.
The purpose of the work was to create a functioning database telling about the organization of excursions for students.
# Task Topic
School trips: type (entertainment /educational), disciplines to which the educational excursion is related, cost per person, list of participants, teacher responsible for conducting.
## Implemented requests:
- excursions to the shipyard (the word "shipyard" anywhere in the name)
- excursions related to biology and geography
- teachers not responsible for excursions
- students, who did not go to the Museum of the History of religion, but went to the Hermitage
- the teacher who was responsible for the number of excursions above the average
- the teachers responsible for the most expensive excursions
- Excursions that all students went to
